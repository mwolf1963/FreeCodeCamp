      <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>Common frog is semi-aquatic amphibian that belongs to the family of true frogs. There are three subspecies of common frog that can be found all over the Europe (up to the Arctic circle) and in some parts of Asia. Common frog usually inhabits meadows, gardens and woodlands. It is equally well adapted to the life on the solid ground and in the water. Major threats for the survival of common frog in the wild are fungal infections and habitat loss. Luckily, global population of common frogs is still large and stable and these frogs are not on the list of endangered species. ,</p>

        <h3>Habitat</h3>
           <p>Frogs, being amphibians, begin their lives in water, moving onto lands in their adulthood. Having said that, there are various species of frogs that don't follow the cycle - some are adapted to live on trees, while some spend their lives in the water throughout. Those dwelling in desert areas burrow into the ground and go into the dormant state during the dry season. This state is called estivation; they return in the rainy season. While those living in colder regions undergo hibernation in winters - burrowing into mud, or underneath the foliage litter. Some also freeze in colder climates and get thawed in the spring. This is their outstanding adaption to varying climates.</p>

      <h3>Diet</h3>
          <p>A lot of people have no idea that frogs are not only the prey of many larger animals, but also what frogs eat exactly.  Have you ever had a pet frog?  If not, that you are probably not familiar with the fact that frogs actually do eat other live prey and are definitely not vegetarians by any means.  Insects, snails, spiders, worms and even small fish have all been known to be part of a frog’s diet and while some bigger frogs had been known to go after something as big as a mouse, there are still those frogs that just stick to insects. One of the neat facts about how frogs eat is that they have no teeth.  Similar to snakes, frogs have to swallow their entire meal whole because they can not chew anything.  Usually, frogs will only use the upper jaw to hold onto their prey, it is not used for biting or chewing at all.  One of the most memorable things that people usually pick up on is the sticky tongue that all frogs have.  This tongue takes less than a second to roll out and once it is out, whichever insect they are attempting to catch will not have any time at all to react. This frog at Dow Gardens Butterfly House is enjoying a snack. Another cool fact about how frogs eat is the fact that their eyes help them swallow.  As you may have noticed in some of the photographs of frogs up close, when frogs eat, their eyes actually sink through the opening of their skull in order force the food to go down their throat.  This is one of the main reasons why it seems as if frogs are constantly blinking while they are eating. </p> <br/>
